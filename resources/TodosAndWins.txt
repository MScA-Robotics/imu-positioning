Without recording controls/backtracker return to starting position after random drive
Setup for user to provide independent controls for demonstration

Control-Velocity motion model that is independent from sensor (acceleratometer and gyroscope)
Sensor-Velocity motion model (independent from control)
EKF algorithm for independent velocity models

Todo:
