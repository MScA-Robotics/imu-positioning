Without recording controls/backtracker return to starting position after random drive
Setup for user to provide independent controls for demonstration

Control-Velocity motion model that is independent from sensor (acceleratometer and gyroscope)
Sensor-Velocity motion model (independent from control)
EKF algorithm for independent velocity models

Todo:
Visualization during drive
Plugin the EKF into real-time drive measurements (RT-EFK)

Other Todo:
Calibration
ROS 

Tuesday 7:00
ROS Review
Thursday 7:00
Calibration Review -> RT-EKF
Saturday ???
Working Session for Real-Time Visualization and RT-EKF

- Setup lidar on GoPiGo Robot - Working with Robopeak Frame Grabber
 We will need to create our own program to receive data stream from sensor.
 tty/USB0 was the port for getting data from the lidar

Tuesday 7:00
Move Kalman filter into live robot program
Thursday 7:00
Visualization aspects

Saturday ???
Working Session for Real-Time Visualization and RT-EKF

SLAM/Future TODO
ROS Review
Gazebo and ARGoS Setup
Create lidar program for gpg to access

IMU TODO
Move Kalman filter into live robot program
Standardize/Centralize calibrations
Visualize density of prediction - layer in covariance to show contour plot
